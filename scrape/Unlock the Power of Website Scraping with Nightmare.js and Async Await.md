# Unlock the Power of Website Scraping with Nightmare.js and Async Await

Scraping websites has become a necessity for developers and data enthusiasts, especially in fields like data journalism. While tools like Python's Beautiful Soup have long been popular, there's an underrated JavaScript alternative that's perfect for the job: **Nightmare.js**.

In this guide, weâ€™ll explore how Nightmare.js, paired with modern JavaScript features like **async/await**, can streamline your scraping tasks. Whether you're dealing with AJAX-heavy pages or navigating forms and cookies, Nightmare.js offers powerful capabilities that make it an exceptional choice.

## Why Use Nightmare.js for Web Scraping?

There are generally two approaches to writing a scraper:

1. **Direct Requests:**  
   Fetch the HTML of a webpage using a parameterized URL, then parse the data and follow links for further requests.
   
2. **Browser Automation:**  
   Use a headless browser to navigate through a site, fill out forms, and execute JavaScript.

Nightmare.js falls into the second category. By automating a browser (based on Electron, a Chrome-derived framework), it can handle JavaScript-heavy websites, submit forms, manage cookies, and bypass complex client-side rendering. This makes it ideal for scraping websites that rely heavily on **AJAX** or client-side rendering.

### Key Benefits:
- **Client-Side Rendering:** Handle dynamic content that would otherwise be inaccessible through traditional HTTP requests.
- **Form Submission:** Interact with forms, clicks, and other user inputs seamlessly.
- **Built-In JavaScript Execution:** Bypass challenges that would trip up other scraping methods.

## Setting Up Your Scraper

### Step 1: Install Node.js 7+

To use Nightmare.js effectively, youâ€™ll need Node.js 7+ to take advantage of **async/await**. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

#### On macOS
Use the `n` version manager:
```bash
$ brew install n
$ n latest
```

#### On Windows
Try a tool like [Nodist](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist), or download the latest version of Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org).

---

### Step 2: Initialize Your Project

Create a new directory for your project:
```bash
$ mkdir scraping-project && cd scraping-project
$ npm init -y
```

This generates a `package.json` file, which youâ€™ll use to manage dependencies.

Install the required libraries:
```bash
$ npm install nightmare d3-dsv --save
```

- **Nightmare:** The core library for browser automation.
- **d3-dsv:** Useful for parsing and writing CSV files.

### Step 3: Map Your Scraping Workflow

Before writing code, outline the process your scraper will follow. This might include:

- Identifying key elements or input fields on the target page.
- Submitting forms or navigating pages.
- Extracting data from specific elements.
- Saving the results in a structured format like CSV.

For this guide, weâ€™ll scrape land registry title numbers from the UK Land Registry to fetch corresponding addresses. You can download a sample dataset for this task:  
[Download CSV](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aendrew/76f3fae770e647ae7b0ea865ba0c4418/raw/eb047d0b74cc539a7fa873b1594e28e1dc310f6f/tesco-title-numbers.csv)

Save the file as `tesco-title-numbers.csv` in your project directory.

---

## Writing Your Scraper with Nightmare.js

Create a new file, `index.js`, in your project folder. Start by importing the necessary modules and reading the input CSV file:

```javascript
const { csvFormat } = require('d3-dsv');
const Nightmare = require('nightmare');
const { readFileSync, writeFileSync } = require('fs');

// Read and parse input CSV
const numbers = readFileSync('./tesco-title-numbers.csv', { encoding: 'utf8' })
  .trim()
  .split('\n');
console.dir(numbers);
```

---

### Using Async/Await with Nightmare.js

**Async/await** simplifies handling asynchronous tasks, such as navigating through a site and waiting for elements to load. Hereâ€™s an example function to scrape data:

```javascript
const getAddress = async (id) => {
  console.log(`Scraping data for: ${id}`);
  const nightmare = new Nightmare({ show: true });

  try {
    // Navigate to the site and search for the title number
    await nightmare
      .goto('https://example-land-registry.com')
      .wait('input[name="titleNo"]')
      .type('input[name="titleNo"]', id)
      .click('input[value="Search"]')
      .wait('.result-class');

    // Extract the address and lease details
    const result = await nightmare
      .evaluate(() => {
        const elements = document.querySelectorAll('.result-class');
        return [...elements].map(el => el.innerText);
      })
      .end();

    return { id, address: result[0], lease: result[1] };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to scrape data for ${id}:`, error);
    return null;
  }
};
```

### Handling Multiple Requests Sequentially

To avoid overwhelming the server, process requests one at a time using `Array.reduce`:

```javascript
const scrapeData = numbers.reduce(async (queue, number) => {
  const dataArray = await queue;
  const data = await getAddress(number);
  if (data) dataArray.push(data);
  return dataArray;
}, Promise.resolve([]));
```

Once all requests are complete, save the results to a CSV file:

```javascript
scrapeData
  .then((data) => {
    const csvData = csvFormat(data);
    writeFileSync('./output.csv', csvData, { encoding: 'utf8' });
    console.log('Scraping complete. Results saved to output.csv');
  })
  .catch((error) => console.error('Error during scraping:', error));
```

### Running Your Scraper

Run your script with the following command:
```bash
$ node index.js
```

Watch as Nightmare.js processes each request and writes the results to `output.csv`.

## Best Practices for Web Scraping

1. **Respect Website Policies:** Always check the site's terms of service to ensure compliance.
2. **Throttle Requests:** Avoid overwhelming servers by adding delays between requests or processing sequentially.
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Use `try/catch` blocks to recover from errors without crashing your scraper.
4. **Test with Show Mode:** Set `show: true` in Nightmare to visualize the scraping process during development.
5. **Save Incrementally:** Write data to disk after each successful request to prevent data loss if the script fails.

## Take Your Scraping to the Next Level

Nightmare.js is just the beginning. You can extend your scraper with advanced features like:

- **Event Handling:** React to page events, such as redirects or popups.
- **Screenshots:** Capture screenshots for debugging or visual verification.
- **Headless Mode:** Run the scraper in the background by setting `show: false`.
