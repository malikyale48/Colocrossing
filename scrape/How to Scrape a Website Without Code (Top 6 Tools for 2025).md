## What Is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using automated tools. The process typically involves these steps:

1. **Fetching**: Download the page content.
2. **Parsing**: Extract specific data fields.
3. **Formatting**: Organize the data into a readable format.
4. **Storing**: Save the data to a database, spreadsheet, or another storage system.

No matter which method or tool you choose, these steps remain consistent.

### Traditional vs. No-Code Web Scraping
Until recently, coding skills and programming languages like Python were required to scrape data. But with the rise of no-code tools, anyone can extract structured data from the web. These tools allow users to simply click on webpage elements to define the data they want to extract.

## Can I Scrape Data From Any Website?

Yes, web scraping can extract unstructured data from websites and organize it into structured formats. However, always check the website's "robots.txt" file to see if scraping is permitted. Simply append `/robots.txt` to the website's URL to find this file. For instance, the robots.txt file for [ScraperAPI](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi) would be at `https://bit.ly/Scraperapi/robots.txt`.

## Is Web Scraping Legal?

Web scraping is generally legal when extracting publicly available data. However, itâ€™s essential to ensure compliance with laws and website terms of use. While scraping public data is often permissible, publishing or redistributing it may violate copyright or intellectual property laws.
