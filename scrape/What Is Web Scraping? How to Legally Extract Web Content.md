## What Is Web Scraping?

Web scraping refers to the automated process of extracting data from websites using software tools. For instance:
- Price comparison websites use web scraping to aggregate product prices from various online stores.
- Search engines like Google use web scraping, or "crawling," to index websites.

Web scraping is a versatile technique with numerous use cases, including market research, price comparisons, content monitoring, and more.

## Is Web Scraping Legal?

Yes, web scraping is generally legal when collecting publicly available data. For example:

- However, scraping private data or intellectual property can lead to legal issues, such as DMCA takedown notices.

### Malicious Web Scraping
Malicious web scraping involves extracting data without the publisherâ€™s consent or scraping personal data. Examples include:
- Over-scraping, where bots send too many requests and strain servers.
- Extracting data protected by laws such as GDPR or CCPA.

To stay ethical and legal, always scrape data that is clearly intended for public use and adhere to website terms of service.
