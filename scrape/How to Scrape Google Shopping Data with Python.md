### 3. Writing Your Scraper

Hereâ€™s how to write a scraper for Google Shopping:

#### Example Code to Scrape SERP Data

```python
from scrapeapi import ScraperAPIClient
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import json

api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
client = ScraperAPIClient(api_key)

def scrape_google_shopping(url):
    response = client.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    products = []
    for item in soup.select('.sh-dgr__grid-result'):
        title = item.select_one('h3').text.strip() if item.select_one('h3') else None
        price = item.select_one('.a8Pemb').text.strip() if item.select_one('.a8Pemb') else None
        retailer = item.select_one('.aULzUe').text.strip() if item.select_one('.aULzUe') else None
        products.append({"title": title, "price": price, "retailer": retailer})
    
    return products

# Example usage
url = 'https://www.google.com/search?q=laptops&tbm=shop'
data = scrape_google_shopping(url)
print(json.dumps(data, indent=4))
```

#### Handling Pagination
Modify the `start` parameter in the URL to scrape multiple pages:

```python
def scrape_multiple_pages(base_url, pages):
    all_products = []
    for page in range(pages):
        paginated_url = f"{base_url}&start={page * 20}"
        all_products.extend(scrape_google_shopping(paginated_url))
    return all_products
```

## Scraping Individual Product Pages

To extract detailed information about specific products, scrape individual product pages.

### Example Code to Scrape Product Pages

```python
def scrape_product_page(url):
    response = client.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    title = soup.select_one('.sh-np__product-title').get_text(strip=True)
    price = soup.select_one('.T14wmb').get_text(strip=True)
    description = soup.select_one('.sh-np__description').get_text(strip=True)
    
    return {"title": title, "price": price, "description": description}

# Example usage
product_url = 'https://www.google.com/shopping/product/123456789'
product_data = scrape_product_page(product_url)
print(product_data)
```

Save the scraped data to a JSON file:

```python
def save_to_json(data, filename):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        json.dump(data, file, indent=4)
```
