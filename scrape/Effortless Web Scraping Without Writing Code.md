# Effortless Web Scraping Without Writing Code

## Introduction

Today, let's explore a way to scrape data without writing codeâ€”a method that meets the needs of many users. This approach is perfect for those who need to gather data quickly and efficiently without the technical complexities of programming.

Typically, web scraping involves writing code to make network requests and fetch web pages. However, for some websites with asynchronous loading or obfuscated JavaScript, analyzing the data can become challenging. Many web scraping enthusiasts aren't professional programmers, making coding a daunting task. From my experience, most web scraping needs in companies are one-time projects requiring a small-scale data volume of tens of thousands of records at most. For such scenarios, there's no need to write programsâ€”a tool like **Web Scraper** can do the job effectively.

### Step 2: Configuring Web Scraper Rules

Configuring Web Scraper involves creating a starting point and defining extraction rules. Here's how:

#### Step 2.1: Setting a Start URL
For instance, to scrape restaurant names and reviews from a food review site, the first step is to set the food category page as the **Start URL**.

#### Step 2.2: Handling Pagination
Check the site's pagination pattern. For example:

- Page 2 URL: `http://www.dianping.com/shanghai/ch10/g1338p2`
- Page 3 URL: `http://www.dianping.com/shanghai/ch10/g1338p3`

You can use a pattern like this:  
`http://www.dianping.com/shanghai/ch10/g1338p[0-5]`  
This pattern ensures you scrape data from pages 1 to 5.

#### Step 2.3: Extracting Links to Detail Pages
Next, configure rules to extract URLs of specific store pages. Simply select a few items on the page, and the tool will automatically generate XPath rules for extracting the data.

#### Step 2.4: Extracting Specific Details
Finally, define rules to extract the details you need, such as user reviews. For example:
