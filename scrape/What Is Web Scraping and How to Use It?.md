## What Is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites and converting it into a structured format, such as a spreadsheet or database. While some websites provide APIs for easy data access, many do not. In such cases, web scraping becomes the go-to solution for gathering large amounts of data efficiently.

### How It Works:
1. **Crawler**: A program that browses the web to find the data you need by following links across websites.
2. **Scraper**: A tool that extracts specific data from a webpage, which is then structured and saved for use.

For example, instead of manually collecting product details from an e-commerce website, a web scraper can automate the process, saving both time and effort.

## How Do Web Scrapers Work?

Web scrapers can extract all the data on a website or target specific information based on user-defined parameters. The typical process involves:

1. **Providing URLs**: The user specifies the URLs to scrape.
2. **Loading HTML**: The scraper loads the websiteâ€™s HTML code, and in advanced cases, also extracts CSS and JavaScript elements.
3. **Extracting Data**: The scraper extracts the required data fields from the HTML code.
4. **Outputting Data**: The data is saved in formats like CSV, Excel, or JSON, based on user preferences.

For instance, when scraping an Amazon product page, you can extract details like product name, price, and availability without including unnecessary information such as customer reviews.
