- **Image Thumbnails**: Small preview images of the products.
- **Product Titles**: Names of the products.
- **Ratings**: Customer feedback and reviews.

## Steps to Scrape Google Shopping

In this tutorial, we will use **Python Requests** for HTTP handling and **LXML** for parsing and extracting data.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries:
```bash
$ pip install requests
$ pip install lxml
```

### 2. Import Required Libraries
```python
import csv
import re
import requests
from lxml import html
```

### 3. Set Up HTTP Headers
Define headers to simulate browser behavior:
```python
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36",
    "Referer": "https://shopping.google.com/",
}
```

### 4. Save Data to CSV
Create a function to save the extracted data into a CSV file:
```python
def save_as_csv(data):
    fieldnames = ["title", "image_url", "rating", "website", "price", "url"]
    with open("products.csv", "w", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)
        writer.writeheader()
        for row in data:
            writer.writerow(row)
```

### 5. Extract Product URLs from the Listing Page
Generate and scrape the listing page:
```python
def parse_listing_page(search_term):
    url = f"https://www.google.com/search?q={search_term}&tbm=shop"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    tree = html.fromstring(response.content)
    product_urls = tree.xpath('//a[@class="xCpuod"]/@href')
    return product_urls
```

### 6. Scrape Product Details
Extract detailed product information:
```python
def parse_product_page(product_urls):
    data = []
    for product_url in product_urls:
        url = f"https://www.google.com{product_url}"
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        tree = html.fromstring(response.content)

        title = tree.xpath("//span[contains(@class, 't__title')]/text()")
        image_url = tree.xpath("//img[@class='product-image']/@src")
        rating = tree.xpath("//div[@class='rating']/@aria-label")
        price_table = tree.xpath("//table[@class='price-table']/tbody/tr")

        for row in price_table:
            website = row.xpath("./td[1]//a/text()")
            price = row.xpath("./td[2]/span/text()")
            if website:
                data.append({
                    "title": title[0] if title else None,
                    "image_url": image_url[0] if image_url else None,
                    "rating": rating[0] if rating else None,
                    "website": website[0],
                    "price": price[0] if price else None,
                    "url": url
                })
    return data
```

### 7. Combine Functions
Combine all functions into a complete script:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    search_term = "laptop"
    product_urls = parse_listing_page(search_term)
    data = parse_product_page(product_urls)
    save_as_csv(data)
    print("Scraping completed. Data saved to products.csv")
```

Run the script to scrape data:
```bash
$ python script.py
```

## Key Considerations for Scraping

1. **Respect Robots.txt**: Always check the site's terms of service and scraping policies.
2. **Use Proxies**: Avoid getting blocked by rotating proxies during scraping.
3. **Implement Delays**: Introduce delays between requests to prevent overloading servers.
4. **Monitor Scraping**: Log errors and exceptions to identify and resolve issues.
